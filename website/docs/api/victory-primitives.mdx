title: VictoryPrimitives
---

Victory is built around a set of simple, stateless components. Along with [VictoryContainer][], [VictoryClipContainer][], and [VictoryLabel][], the following list represents every simple element a Victory component might render. These simple components are responsible for supplying props to primitive components. Victory maintains a small subset of primitive components with additional logic in place to prevent unnecessary rendering. Extracting every rendered element into its own component allows Victory to support both web and React Native applications with very little additional code, as only a few components need to be modified to render [react-native-svg][] elements rather than SVG elements. These primitives are also exposed for users to wrap, extend or reference when creating their own custom rendered components.

## Primitive Components

Each of these primitive components renders SVG elements. The following components are the only Victory components that render SVG elements with the exception of `VictoryContainer` and `VictoryPortal`. These elements are used by other simple components such as `Bar` and `Area`.

### Border

```jsx
const Border = (props) => <Rect {...props} />;
```

### Circle

Used by `Background`, `VictoryClipContainer`, and `Voronoi`

```jsx
const Circle = (props) => <circle vectorEffect="non-scaling-stroke" {...props} />;
```

### ClipPath

Used by `VictoryClipContainer` and `Voronoi`

```jsx
const ClipPath = (props) => (
  <defs>
    <clipPath id={props.clipId}>{props.children}</clipPath>
  </defs>
);
```

### Line

Used by `Axis`, `Candle`, and `ErrorBar`

```jsx
const Line = (props) => <line vectorEffect="non-scaling-stroke" {...props} />;
```

### Path

Used by `Arc`, `Area`, `Bar`, `Curve`, `Flyout`, `Point`, `Slice`, and `Voronoi`

```jsx

```

### Rect

```jsx
const Text = (props) => {
  const { children, title, desc, ...rest } = props;
  return (
    <text {...rest}>
      {title && <title>{title}</title>}
      {desc && <desc>{desc}</desc>}
      {children}
    </text>
  );
};
```

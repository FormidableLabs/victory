title: VictoryAnimation
---

:::info
[See this guide to animations with Victory Charts](/docs/guides/animations). The `VictoryAnimation` component is used for animating arbitrary React components and is not commonly used.
:::

`VictoryAnimation` animates prop changes for any React component. To animate prop changes, define a child function that accepts an object of tweened values and other animation information and returns a component to render.

```jsx
<VictoryAnimation {...animationProps} data={myComponentProps}>
  {(tweenedProps, animationInfo) => {
    if (animationInfo.animating && animationInfo.progress < 1) {
      return <MyComponent {...tweenedProps} />;
    }
  }}
</VictoryAnimation>
```

## Props

---

### children

<Badges>
  <TypeBadge value="(style: AnimationStyle, info: AnimationInfo) => React.ReactElement" />
</Badges>

`VictoryAnimation` takes a single child, which should be given as a function of a tweened props object and an animation information object. The child function should return a component to render.

---

### data

<Badges>
  <TypeBadge value="AnimationData" />
</Badges>


The `data` prop specifies a set of values to tween between. When this prop changes, `VictoryAnimation` will begin animating between the current and next values. This prop should be given as an array or an object. `VictoryAnimation` uses [d3-interpolate][] to tween between values, with some [slight modifications][].

---

### duration

<Badges>
  <TypeBadge value="number" />
  <DefaultsBadge value="1000" />
</Badges>

The `duration` prop determines the number of milliseconds the animation should take to complete. This prop should be given as a number.

---

### delay

<Badges>
  <TypeBadge value="number" />
  <DefaultsBadge value="10" />
</Badges>

The `delay` prop specifies a delay in milliseconds before the start of an animation, or between each animation in the queue. This prop should be given as a number.

### easing

<Badges>
  <TypeBadge value="AnimationEasing" />
  <DefaultsBadge value='"quadInOut"' />
</Badges>

The `easing` prop specifies the type of easing to use for an animation. The supported types of easing are: _"back", "backIn", "backOut", "backInOut", "bounce", "bounceIn", "bounceOut", "bounceInOut", "circle", "circleIn", "circleOut", "circleInOut", "linear", "linearIn", "linearOut", "linearInOut", "cubic", "cubicIn", "cubicOut", "cubicInOut", "elastic", "elasticIn", "elasticOut", "elasticInOut", "exp", "expIn", "expOut", "expInOut", "poly", "polyIn", "polyOut", "polyInOut", "quad", "quadIn", "quadOut", "quadInOut", "sin", "sinIn", "sinOut", "sinInOut"_.

---

### onEnd

<Badges>
  <TypeBadge value="() => void" />
</Badges>

The `onEnd` prop specifies a function that will be called when the animation ends. If there are multiple animations in the queue, the `onEnd` function will be called after the last animation in the queue completes.

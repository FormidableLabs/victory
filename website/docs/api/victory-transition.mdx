title: VictoryTransition

`VictoryTransition` wraps a single child component in `VictoryAnimation`. In addition to animating the child component, it will also handle transitions for any entering and exiting nodes via the `onEnter` and `onExit` and `onLoad` transitions defined on its `animate` prop.

This component is not typically used. Visit the [Animation](/docs/guides/animations) guide for examples of how to add animation to charts.

The `animate` prop specifies props for VictoryAnimation and VictoryTransition to use. The animate prop may be used to specify the duration, delay and easing of an animation as well as the behavior of `onEnter` and `onExit` and `onLoad` transitions. Each Victory component defines its own default transitions, but these may be modified, or overwritten with the `animate` prop.

_examples:_ `animate={{duration: 2000, onLoad: {duration: 1000}, onEnter: {duration: 500, before: () => ({y: 0})}}}`

### animationWhitelist

:::warning
These docs are for the legacy versions of Victory Native. Victory Native XL is our rewrite of Victory Native designed specifically for React Native. Please [see here for more information](https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/victory-native/). If you would like to continue to use this version of Victory with React Native, follow the legacy guide below.
:::

## Getting Started

In this guide, we’ll show you how to get started with Victory Native and the React Native SVG dependency running in your React Native app for iOS and Android.

### 1. Adding Victory Native to your React Native app

Visit [the guide on getting started](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) with React Native if you’re just getting started with React Native.

Victory Native is compatible with React Native 0.50 or higher.

To add Victory Native to your React Native app install `victory-native`.

```bash
$ yarn add victory-native@legacy # or npm install --save victory-native@legacy
```

### 2. Add React Native SVG to your app

If you are building a project with native code, you will need to link the native dependencies of React Native SVG to the iOS and Android projects.

This step is not required if you are using Expo (SDK 23.0.0 or higher) as it is already included.

React Native 0.60 or newer:
```bash
$ yarn add react-native-svg  # or npm install --save react-native-svg
$ cd ios
$ pod install
```

React Native below 0.60:
```bash
$ react-native install react-native-svg
```

*note:* If you run the iOS app and see a linker error for `-lRNSVG-tvOS` you will need to remove `libRNSVG-tvOS.a` from the “Link Binary with Libraries” section within your iOS app’s target’s properties.

### 3. Using Victory Native in your React Native app

Victory Native behaves and functions the same way for React Native as it does for the web. Just import components from `victory-native` to get started. To learn more about how to use Victory visit the [Getting Started Guide][].

The example below shows how Victory Native easily integrates within your React Native app.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { StyleSheet, View } from "react-native";
import { VictoryBar, VictoryChart, VictoryTheme } from "victory-native";

const data = [
  { quarter: 1, earnings: 13000 },
  { quarter: 2, earnings: 16500 },
  { quarter: 3, earnings: 14250 },
  { quarter: 4, earnings: 19000 }
];

export default function App() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <VictoryChart width={350} theme={VictoryTheme.clean}>
        <VictoryBar data={data} x="quarter" y="earnings" />
      </VictoryChart>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center",
    backgroundColor: "#f5fcff"
  }
});
```

### 4. Ignoring require cycles

- see [https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/issues/2230](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/issues/2230)

As of victory@36.4.0, React Native apps (on both iOS and Android) will warn about require cycles.

These warnings will not affect the functionality of `victory-native` or your app, and can be safely disabled.

To disable the warnings, modify your app's entry point (usually `index.js`) to include

```js
LogBox.ignoreLogs([
  "Require cycle: node_modules/victory",
]);
```

as shown below

```diff
+import { AppRegistry, LogBox } from "react-native";
import App from "./App";
import { name as appName } from "./app.json";

+LogBox.ignoreLogs(['Require cycle: node_modules/victory']);

AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => App);
```

### 5. Testing Components that use Victory Native

You can test your components that render Victory Native using Jest and React Test Renderer which is included out–of–the box with React Native. The `jest` configuration section in `package.json` will need to be modified to ensure dependencies are transformed otherwise you will see an error when tests are run.

```json
"jest": {
  "preset": "react-native",
  "transformIgnorePatterns": [
    "node_modules/(?!victory|react-native-svg|react-native)"
  ],
  "transform": {
    "^.+\\.jsx?$": "babel-jest"
  }
}
```

To test the above `App` component you can simply do:

```jsx
import "react-native";
import React from "react";
import App from "../App.js";
import renderer from "react-test-renderer";

it("renders correctly", () => {
  const tree = renderer.create(<App />);
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

*note:* `renderer` must be imported _after_ `react-native` for tests to work.


## Expo Web Apps

Whilst using `victory-native` in Expo apps that target iOS & Android is fully supported, we do not support building for the web with `victory-native`.

However as both `victory-native` and `victory` share the same public API, it's possible to configure your Expo project so that it automatically uses `victory-native` when building your native apps for iOS & Android, and `victory` when building your web app.

> ☣️ Please note that while you can follow the instructions below to configure your Expo project to make this work, Victory does not officially support Expo Web apps.

```sh
yarn add -D @expo/webpack-config
```

Then, create a `webpack.config.js` file in the root of your Expo project

```js
const createExpoWebpackConfigAsync = require('@expo/webpack-config');

module.exports = async function(env, argv) {
  const config = await createExpoWebpackConfigAsync(env, argv);

  // resolve victory-native as victory for the Web app
  config.resolve.alias['victory-native'] = 'victory';

  return config;
};
```

### Peer Dependencies and Version Requirements

**Note:** `victory-native` requires the following peer dependencies:
- `react-native-svg`
- `react`
- `react-native`

**Note:** `react-native-svg` has strict version requirements for both `react` and `react-native`. Please match versions to those required by `react-native-svg`. See the up-to-date requirements on the [react-native-svg Readme][react-native-svg-readme].
We encourage you to use the latest version of `react-native-svg` possible for your project, as `victory-native` issues are frequently solved by `react-native-svg` bugfixes.

- `victory-native@^33.0.0` requires `react-native-svg@^9.0.0` and `react-native@~0.60.0`
* `victory-native@^30.0.0` requires `react-native-svg@6.1.x`  or `react-native-svg@^6.5.0`and above
* `victory-native@^0.16.2` requires `react-native-svg@6.1.x` or `react-native-svg@^6.5.0`
* ~~`victory-native@~0.16.0` requires `react-native-svg@6.0.0`~~ No longer supported
* ~~`victory-native@~0.15.0` requires `react-native-svg@^5.0.0`~~ No longer supported

### Local Development and Demo

If you'd like to contribute to `victory-native`, you can use the local demo app to test your changes on the iOS simulator. The demo app uses [Expo](https://expo.dev/) to streamline this dev experience.

To open the demo app, just fire up the expo app.

```sh
# Install victory and its dependencies
$ git clone https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory
$ cd victory
$ yarn install
# Open up the React Native demo app
$ cd demo/rn
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

Once Expo has fired up, it should open a web browser window where you can find instructions to open the demo application (either on a simulator or a physical device using the Expo Go app).

Changes to the Victory and Victory Native source code will be reflected in the demo app.

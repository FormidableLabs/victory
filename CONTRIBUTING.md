# Contributing

Thanks for helping out!

## Monorepo!

Victory is a monorepo built with [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) workspaces. All `victory-*` packages live in the `packages` directory, and each has its own `package.json`. Installing this repo with `yarn` will automatically link all interdependent `victory-*` packages. **You must use `yarn` rather than `npm` when installing and running `package.json` scripts in this project.**

## `package-scripts.js`

Victory uses [`nps`](https://github.com/kentcdodds/nps) to organize package scripts. Check `package-scripts.js` for the full list of commands.

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 8.10.0 or higher.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) 1.7.0 or higher.

### Setup

Clone this repo:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory.git
$ cd victory
```

Use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install dependencies:

```console
$ yarn install
```

Run a development server and check out the demos. Demos will be served at localhost:3000/. This command will also build and watch `lib/` and `es/` directories in all packages, so your demos will always be in sync with code changes.

```console
$ yarn start
```

## Checks, Tests

All checks and tests run from the root directory.

The `check` script will lint all packages and infrastructure before building packages and starting a test server and running our suite of tests

If your terminal is under a proxy, you should turn off the proxy, or ChromeHeadless will not start properly.

```console
$ yarn nps check
$ yarn nps check.dev // if you already have a development server running
```

To run tests without linting, use the `test` script

```console
$ yarn nps test
$ yarn nps test.dev // if you already have a development server running
```

## Visual Tests

Victory relies heavily on visual regression testing with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) and [Chromatic](https://www.chromaticqa.com/).

Write visual tests for new features by adding them in the `stories` directory. Run storybooks and check out changes. Storybooks are served from localhost:6006/

```console
$ yarn storybook
```

[Chromatic](https://www.chromaticqa.com/) provides automated visual testing. All PRs will trigger a new chromatic build, which will be displayed along with CI status. You can also trigger a new build manually with:

```console
$ yarn chromatic
```

**External contributors will not be able to use Chromatic to automate their visual regression testing, as it requires a secret app code.**

## Release

Victory uses [Lerna](https://lernajs.io/) to automate versioning and publishing packages.

Each package must contain the following `version` script `package.json`:

```
"scripts": {
  "version": "nps build-libs && nps build-dists",
}
```

Pre version checks are run _once_ for all packages, and are defined in the root directory `package.json`

```
"preversion": "nps check"
```

The following commands will let you try a version without publishing or creating git commits:

```console
// This command bumps versions, runs checks, builds libs. No git commits will be made, and nothing will be published. `package.json` files in all packages will be altered, so be careful to clean up afterwards.
$ nps lerna-dry-run
```

To publish a package _for real_

```console
$ lerna publish
```

You will be prompted to select an appropriate version before continuing. Lerna will run preversion checks, bump versions in all packages, create git commits, build libs, and publish packages. The whole process takes about 5 minutes. Be patient!

## Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of

and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at lauren.eastridge@formidable.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

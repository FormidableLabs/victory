    * Added very basic Node.js tests to catch future ESM issues.
    * Switch all relative/prefixed import paths to be just `import <name> from "victory-<pkg>"`.
    * Update various dependencies.

## 35.9.0 (2021-06-24)

Adds a new `disableInlineStyles` prop to components and primitives to support users who want to style their components by class, or use a CSS in JS solution like `styled-components`

When the new `disableInlineStyles` prop is supplied to a component like `VictoryBar` no styles will be supplied to either data or label components that it renders:

```jsx
const StyledBar = styled(Bar)`
  fill: purple;
`;
const StyledLabel = styled(VictoryLabel)`
  tspan {
    fill: magenta;
    font-family: Papyrus, fantasy;
  }
`;
function CustomStyledBarChart() {
  return (
    <VictoryChart>
      <VictoryBar
        disableInlineStyles
        labels={[1, 2, 3, 4]}
        dataComponent={<StyledBar />}
        labelComponent={<StyledLabel />}
      />
    </VictoryChart>
  );
}
```

The `disableInlineStyles` prop may also be supplied to primitive components for more granular control:

```jsx
const StyledBar = styled(Bar)`
  fill: purple;
`;
function CustomStyledBarChart() {
  return (
    <VictoryChart>
      <VictoryBar
        labels={[1, 2, 3, 4]}
        dataComponent={<StyledBar disableInlineStyles />}
      />
    </VictoryChart>
  );
}
```

## 35.8.0 (2021-05-19)

- [#1858](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1858) - `domainPadding` updates

updates how `domainPadding` is applied to charts when 1) the additional padding _would not_ result new quadradants being added, or 2) the user has set `singleQuadrantDomainPadding={false}`. In these cases, `domainPadding` is applied by calculating a new, smaller range that takes the desired, pixel-based padding into account, and then adding domain padding such that the previous domain fits entirely within the new, smaller range. In most cases, this change will make it much easier to do things like create bar charts where the first bar starts cleanly at the edge of the chart, by setting `domainPadding={{ x: myBarWidth / 2 }}`
**This may cause visual changes for charts that use very large values for `domainPadding`. The `domainPadding` prop may need to be adjusted**

calculates a more exact `defaultDomainPadding` for grouped bar charts based on the `offset`, number of bars, and the width of each bar (either from the `barWidth` prop or from a default `barWidth` based on the number of bars and the range). Previously, `defaultDomainPadding` was approximated based only on `offset` and number of bars.

## 35.7.0 (2021-05-12)

- [#1835](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1835) - This PR makes `VictoryAxis` responsible for calculating its own default `xOffset`, `yOffset`, `orientation`, and `crossAxis` values rather than relying on `VictoryChart` to determine these values. This change corrects several bugs related to how axes update on charts that use `VictoryZoomContainer`. We don't anticipate breaking changes with this update, but axis positioning will update differently (more correctly) when zooming. Thanks @jhumbug!

### Support for Global Events

This release adds a concept of global events that are attached to `window` rather than to any of the elements rendered by Victory components. Global events are only supported for "parent" events that would normally be attached to `svg` elements rendered by Victory's containerComponents. Events that should be global can be flagged by including `onGlobal` in the name of the event handler. So, for example, use `onGlobalMouseUp` rather than `onMouseUp` to create a global mouse up handler.

### VictoryBrushContainer uses Global Events

`VictoryBrushContainer` now uses global events in its `defaultEvents` so that brushing continues even as the user's mouse moves outside of the chart area.

### Accessibility Improvements

- [#1708](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1708) - This PR adds `ariaLabel` to Victory's primitive components (`VictoryLabel`, `Area`, `Bar` etc.). This new prop can take a string or a function that expected to return a string, and adds `aria-label` attributes to svg elements Victory renders. This PR also adds `tabIndex` and `aria-label` props to `VictoryClipContainer`, and creates a new `groupContainer`, `VictoryAccessibleGroup`, which renders a `g` tag and an optional `desc` tag along with its other children. `VictoryAccessibleGroup` also takes `aria-label` and `aria-describedby` props. Thanks @ljones87 for all the hard work on this new feature!

- [#1709](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1709) - Adds default `onFocus` and `onBlur` event handlers to `VictoryTooltip` so that users can trigger tooltips by tabbing through the chart elements when `tabIndex` is set.

### Label and Theme Improvements!

This release introduces new label features and makes improvements to themes. This release includes breaking style changes. Please double check your label and tooltip styles when upgrading. Polar axes and pie charts may be particularly impacted.

### New Features!

- `VictoryLabel` now supports label backgrounds, which are rendered as `rect` elements behind your labels. Backgrounds are styled via the new `backgroundStyle` prop on `VictoryLabel`. This prop may be given as a style object, or an array of objects for styling multi-line labels. Background elements are sized for their corresponding text elements, but padding may also be added with the `backgroundPadding` prop, which accepts a single number, an object with values for "top", "bottom", "left" and "right", or an array of either of these for adding background padding to multi-line labels.

- `VictoryTooltip` has a new `flyoutPadding` prop that may be used to add padding between the edge of the flyout and the label within it. The `flyoutPadding` prop may be given as a single number of as an object with values for "top", "bottom", "left" and "right". **This is a breaking change**, as `style.padding` no longer adds padding between the flyout and its label. Both of Victory's built-in themes have been altered so that tooltips get `flyoutPadding={5}` by default.

- `VictoryPie` now supports the `labelPlacement` prop used in polar charts. Possible values are "vertical" "parallel" and "perpendicular". When not given, vertical labels are rendered as before.

- Themes now support `polarAxis`, `polarDependentAxis`, and `polarIndependentAxis` namespaces that are merges with the less specific `axis`, `dependentAxis`, and `independentAxis` themes as appropriate.

### Improvements

- Changes Victory's default branch from `master` to `main` ðŸ–¤

- `Textsize` approximations have changed, and are much more accurate in most cases. **This may be a breaking change for layouts that depended on approximated text size**

- Tooltip themes are now correctly merged with label styles and props.

- `VictoryPolarAxis` elements are now rendered relative to the origin independently, rather than being translated as a group. This allows for correct positioning of elements within `VictoryPortal` **This may be a breaking change for custom components in `VictoryPolarAxis`**

- Corrects the `labelPosition` prop on `VictoryPie` (previously `startAngle` and `endAngle` were inverted) **This is a breaking change**

- Alters `material` and `greyscale` themes. **The following theme updates may cause breaking style changes**
  - Uses more widely available default fonts for labels
  - Reduces default label padding for `boxplot` and `candlestick`
  - Adds `polarDependentAxis` settings to the `material` theme
  - Zero padding on from `tooltip` styles override label styles on all other theme namespaces. This means that tooltips pointers will now all start exactly at the data element they correspond to by default. To alter this behavior, either 1) provide a different theme, 2) alter padding in via label styles like so:
    ```
      <VictoryBar
        style={{ labels: { padding: 5 } }}
        labelComponent={<VictoryTooltip />}
      />
    ```
    or
    ```
    <VictoryBar
      labelComponent={
        <VictoryTooltip style={{ padding: 5 }} />
      }
    />
    ```

- [#1531](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1531) - Adds a `VictoryHistogram` component. Huge thanks to @NgoKnows for this new feature!

```
<VictoryHistogram
  binSpacing={1}
  bins={[0, 20, 50, 500]}
  data={[
    { value: 1 }, { value: 1 }, { value: 2 }, { value: 3 } ...
  ]}
  x="value"
/>
```

Histogram bins may be defined with the `bin` prop, which takes either an array of bin edges, or a single number which corresponds to an approximate number of bins. `VictoryHistogram` is meant to work with continuous data, and expects a data prop as an array of objects with x values. By default, histogram bins will be laid out with no spaces between bins, but the optional `binSpacing` prop may be provided to change this behavior. Additional documentation and examples will be coming soon.

## 33.0.0 (2019-08-21)

### Breaking Changes

**Changes for functional props and styles:**

Related PR: [#1360](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1360)

Functional props like `labels` and functional styles will now be called with a single argument instead of `datum` and `active`. The argument passed to functional props and styles will be an object containing all the props that control the rendering of the the target the prop applies to. Including things like `datum`, `active`, `index`, `data`, `scale`, etc. We hope this will give users a lot more flexibility and control. In most cases, this change should be very straightforward to apply

old:

```
labels={(d) => `x: ${d.x}`}
```

new

```
labels={({ datum }) => `x: ${datum.x}`}
```

Gotchas:

- Some of the props passed into functional props and styles may themselves be functions. These will _not_ be evaluated, because we have no way to determine evaluation order. So, if you create a `cornerRadius` function that depends on `barWidth`, do not also make `barWidth` a function of some other prop.
- A few props that take functions do not follow this pattern. These include data accessor functions like `y` and `x`, and `tickFormat`. The arguments for these props have not changed.

**Changes for `VictoryCandlestick` labels**

Related PR: [#1295](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1295)

`VictoryCandlestick` now has granular support for labels corresponding to each portion of the candle. The current `labels` and `labelComponent` props will be joined by new props corresponding to each part of the candle.
_New props_
`lowLabels`
`lowLabelComponent`
`highLabels`
`highLabelComponent`
`openLabels`
`openLabelComponent`
`closeLabels`
`closeLabelComponent`

This will be a breaking change affecting the positioning of the default `label`. In earlier versions, the default label was positioned above the candle, it will now be positioned next to the center of the candle.
To use older label positioning, use `highLabels` / `highLabelComponent` rather than `label` / `labelComponent`. If you are using tooltips with `VictoryCandlestick`, you will need to register a custom event to trigger your `highLabels` tooltip:

example:

```
<VictoryCandlestick
  highLabels={({ datum }) => datum.high}
  highLabelComponent={<VictoryTooltip />}
  events={[{
    target: "data",
    eventHandlers: {
      onMouseOver: () => ({ target: "highLabels", mutation: () => ({ active: true }) }),
      onMouseOut: () => ({ target: "highLabels", mutation: () => ({ active: false }) })
    }
  }]}
/>
```

The `style` prop for `VictoryCandlestick` now also has namespaces for the new labels in addition to the current `labels` namespace. When both `labels` and specific label styles (_e.g._ `highLabels`) are provided, the styles will be merged

**Changes for `VictoryVoronoiContainer`**

Related PR: [#1371](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1371)

Before this version `VictoryVoronoiContainer` had limited functionality for mouse-following tooltips, and for constraining a tooltip to the chart area, but it was only usable for multi-point tooltips (with `voronoiDimension`), and was not user configurable. This version aims to correct these limitations:

- `mouseFollowTooltips`: This new boolean prop on `VictoryVoronoiContainer` determines whether the labels should follow the mouse position or snap into place. (Note that in charts using `voronoiDimension`, the tooltip still follows the mouse in the non-`voronoiDimension`, as demonstrated in the charts below (both with `voronoiDimension="x"`)

`mouseFollowLabels={true}`
![mouseFollowLabels](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3719995/63392113-236ff400-c36a-11e9-91d0-64e674f481d5.gif)

`mouseFollowTooltips={false}`
![non-mouseFollowTooltips](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3719995/63392116-2834a800-c36a-11e9-8a73-a951b131ae2f.gif)

- constrained tooltips: multi-point tooltips rendered by `VictoryVoronoiContainer` will no longer be constrained to the chart area by default. Instead, add the `constrainToVisibleArea` prop to `VictoryTooltip` to enable this behavior for both multi-point and single point tooltips:
  example:

```
containerComponent={
  <VictoryVoronoiContainer
    labelComponent={<VictoryTooltip constrainToVisibleArea />}
  />
}
```

**Changes for `VictoryTooltip` and `VictoryLabel`**

Related PR:[#1371](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1371)

The changes we wanted to make to support new behaviors in `VictoryVoronoiContainer` required some changes to `VictoryTooltip` and `VictoryLabel`

New props for `VictoryTooltip`:

- `constrainToVisibleArea` is a boolean prop that, when true, will alter the position of the tooltip so that it exactly fits within the svg Victory renders. The tooltip's center will be moved, but the pointer will remain pointing at the associated `x`, `y` value of the tooltip. When this prop is set to true, `pointerLength` may not be respected

- `center` is a prop that may be given as an object with values or functions for "x" and "y". When this prop is set, it will position the center of the tooltip (centered around the main body of the tooltip, minus the pointer). When this prop is not set, it will be calculated from other props such as `x`, `y`, `pointerLength`, etc. This prop was added to enable mouse-following tooltips in `VictoryVoronoiContainer`.

- `centerOffset` is a prop that may be given as an object with values or functions for "x" and "y". When this prop is set, the center of the tooltip will be offset by some amount from the x, y value it points to, resulting in a slanted pointer. When this prop is set, `pointerLength` will not be respected (because the pointer will be slanted)

- `flyoutHeight` (formerly `height`): This optional prop determines the height of the tooltip flyout (minus pointer). The name of this prop was changed so that it would not conflict with the `height` prop now passed to `VictoryTooltip` by its parents

- `flyoutWidth` (formerly `width`): This optional prop determines the width of the tooltip flyout (minus pointer). The name of this prop was changed so that it would not conflict with the `width` prop now passed to `VictoryTooltip` by its parents

- `width`: the overall width of the parent svg. This prop will be passed down from any victory component that uses `VictoryTooltip` as a label

- `height`: the overall height of the parent svg. This prop will be passed down from any victory component that uses `VictoryTooltip` as a label

**Changes Affecting `VictoryLabel` and `VictoryTooltip`**

- The `x` and `y` values passed to labels by their parent components have all been adjusted so that their values match the position of the data point they correspond to. All padding is now accounted for in the `dx` and `dy` props instead of being added directly to `x` and `y`.
  This will be a breaking change for anyone who is wrapping label components and relying on the `x` and `y` props they receive, or providing their own `dx` / `dy` props. These breaking changes may take a bit of manual adjustment to correct, but we hope this change will make label positioning easier to reason about in the long run.

**Other Changes**
We have been concurrently working on improving performance and the stability of events in `victory-native`. The following changes have been added to support these efforts:

Related PR: [#1373](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1373)

- A `prependDefaultAxes` boolean prop has been added to `VictoryChart`. This prop will be set true by default in `victory-native` to reduce the possibility of axis elements to interfere with events.
- Invisible ticks and grids will no longer be rendered unless they have events attached to them. This is again to reduce interference with events.

Related PR: [#1365](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1365)

- Swapped out React component primitives (`Bar`, `Path` etc) with for function primitives to match performance-improving changes in `victory-native`. (This is a breaking change for anyone extending from `victory` components)

**Horizontal Chart Improvements!**

[#1258](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1258)

The goal of this change is to make it possible to turn any existing chart into a horizontal chart by adding the `horizontal` prop to the chart without needing to alter any other props.

- supports horizontal versions of all chart types without needing to alter data
- supports all event containers for horizontal charts
- enforces consistency across props that take x and y values so that the `x` value always refers to the _independent_ dimension, and the `y` value always refers to the _dependent_ dimension.
- the orientation of `VictoryAxis` components is no longer tied to whether or not they are the `dependentAxis`

**Breaking Changes**

**Most Horizontal Charts**
The change in how props with x and y values are treated (i.e. `scale`, `domain`, etc) will be a breaking change for most horizontal charts. In most cases, reversing the `x` and `y` values of props you are providing to your horizontal chart will be sufficient to correct the change. For example:

```
<VictoryChart horizontal scale={{ x: "log" }} domain={{ y: [4, 9] }}>
  <VictoryBar
    data={[
      { x: 5, y: 0.1 },
      { x: 6, y: 1 },
      { x: 7, y: 10 },
      { x: 8, y: 100 }
    ]}
  />
</VictoryChart>
```

Should be changed to:

```
<VictoryChart horizontal scale={{ y: "log" }} domain={{ x: [4, 9] }}>
  <VictoryBar
    data={[
      { x: 5, y: 0.1 },
      { x: 6, y: 1 },
      { x: 7, y: 10 },
      { x: 8, y: 100 }
    ]}
  />
</VictoryChart>
```

Props affected by this change are: `scale`, `domain`, `maxDomain`, `minDomain`, `domainPadding`, and `categories`

**Horizontal Charts with Event Containers**
Dimension props such as `brushDimension` have changed so that they always refer to the dimension of the target variable (x for the independent variable, and y for the dependent variable). For example, a `VictoryBrushContainer` component with `brushDimension="x"` will move and expand only in the _independent_ dimension regardless of whether the chart is horizontal.

Props affected by this change are: `brushDimension`, `cursorDimension`, `selectionDimension`, `voronoiDimension`, and `zoomDimension`

**Horizontal Charts with Custom dataComponents**
The position values (i.e. `x`, `y`, `x0`, `y0`) supplied to custom `dataComponents` from components like `VictoryChart` will be scaled for the layout of the horizontal chart. Users who rely on these values may need to flip them or adjust them depending on their use case

**Horizontal VictoryBoxPlot**
Previously `VictoryBoxPlot` required data to be flipped (x values flipped with y values) in order to plot horizontal charts. This is no longer required, and providing data in this format will no longer work correctly. To correct for this change, it should be sufficient to flip the data used in horizontal charts

## 31.3.0 (2019-02-23)

- [1247](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1247) Adds support for `labelOrientation` as an object for `VictoryBoxPlot`. Thanks @mAAdhaTTah

## 31.2.0 (2019-01-27)

**Axis improvements**

- [1244](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1244) Supports the `axisValue` prop for both cartesian and polar charts. This prop allows users to position an axis relative to a value on the opposite axis. Values may be given as numbers, dates, or strings. This prop only works for axis components when they are nested within `VictoryChart`. Standalone axes can still be positioned using `offsetX` and offsetY` props.
- [1240](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1240) Allows multiple independent axes in a single chart

**Removes all deprecated lifecycle methods**

- [1239](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1239) Removes all `componentWillReceiveProps` lifecycle methods and adds `shouldComponentUpdate` logic for higher level components. Previously only the lowest level components performed `sCU` checks.
- [1228](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1228) Replaces `componentWillMount` with `componentDidMount`

**bug fixes**

- [1243](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1243) Prevents `VictoryBrushLine` active brushes from overflowing the brush area when a chart is zoomed
- [1241](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1241) Fixes a regression effecting immutable data rendering
- [1227](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1227) Fixes a minor regression effecting parent event keys introduced by [1211](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1211)

- [1218](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1218) Bugfix: Ensure that calculated domains respect custom baselines for VictoryBar and VictoryArea

- [1211](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1211) Performance: Optimize stringMap calculations
- [1212](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1212) Performance: Optimize for preformatted data:
  When data objects already contain `_x`, `_y` (and `_y0` where appropriate) and have data accessor props like `x="_x"`, data will no longer be formatted by Victory, but will be used as is.
  Example:
  ```
  <VictoryArea
    data={[ { _x: 0, _y0: 1, _y: 2 } ...]}
    x="_x"
    y="_y"
    y0="_y0"
  />
  ```
- [1209](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1209) Feature: Adds an `animationWhitelist` property to the `animate` prop. This property should be given as an array of strings. When this prop is given, only the prop names matching the array will be animated, and all other props will be instantaneously updates.

  Example:

  ```
  <VictoryBar
    animate={{
      animationWhitelist: ["data"]
    }}
    data={this.state.data}
    style={{
      data: this.state.style
    }}
  />
  ```

  When this property is not set, the `static animationWhitelist` of any given component will be used.

## 31.0.0 (2018-11-10)

- [#1177](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/1177) Adds support for controlling `radius`, `innerRadius`, `cornerRadius`, `padAngle`, `sliceStartAngle` and `sliceEndAngle` for each individual slice of a pie:

Details:
The `Slice` primitive used by `VictoryPie` now takes `radius`, `cornerRadius`, `innerRadius`, `padAngle`, `sliceStartAngle` and `sliceEndAngle` props. Each of these props may be given as number or a function of `datum` and `active`. `padAngle`, `radius`, `cornerRadius` and `innerRadius` will be passed down from props on `VictoryBar`, but `sliceStartAngle` and `sliceEndAngle` must be defined directly on the `Slice` instance, These values should be given in degrees. To make these values easier to use as functional props, `startAngle`, `endAngle`, and `padAngle` (in degrees) are added to each `datum` passed into `Slice`. (If your data already has these properties they will _not_ be overridden)

_Breaking Changes_
The `Slice` primitive will still take a `pathFunction` prop, but this prop will no longer be provided by `VictoryPie`. This will not be a breaking change for most users. This will only affect users who were wrapping the `Slice` component and making use of the `pathFunction` prop provided by `VictoryPie` Users who were providing their own `pathFunction` prop to `Slice` should not be effected.

  - Artifacts caused by `cornerRadius` values larger than the height of the bar have been corrected
  - `cornerRadius` now supports `topLeft`, `topRight`, `bottomLeft` and `bottomRight` values in addition to existing values. This is not a breaking change. These values may be used alongside existing values for `top` and `bottom`, but more specific values will override less specific values.

This PR changes how the exported helper `reduceChildren` operates, and removes `getDomainFromGroupedData` -[392](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-core/pull/392) Make sure transforms are applied to primitive components

VictoryChart -[555](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/555) Refactors how `VictoryStack` and `VictoryGroup` interact with child data. Fixes bugs related to stacked and grouped charts in `VictoryVoronoiContainer`

## 0.27.0 (2018-06-05)

**Breaking Changes**

- Refactors utility methods. This is an internal breaking change, but should not be a breaking change for most Victory users. See [victory-core/380](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-core/pull/380) for details
- Upgrades to `react-fast-compare@^2.0.0` which changes function comparison. This means that Victory components _will_ update when functions are not equal. This closes several Victory issues, but may cause a slight performance decline

**New Features**

- Adds `minDomain` and `maxDomain` props. These props may be used to set one edge of a domain while allowing the other edge to be determined by data or other props. `minDomain` and `maxDomain` override `domainPadding`.
- Adds `singleQuadrantDomainPadding` prop. This prop may be given as a boolean or an object with boolean values for x and y. When this prop is set to `false` for a given dimension, any `domainPadding` applied in that dimension will _not_ be constrained to existing quadrants.

## 0.26.0 (2018-04-21)

**BREAKING CHANGES**

_Disable arbitrary styles from data_
This change deprecates Victory's ability to automatically pick up style attributes from the data object. This change will improve performance, but will be a breaking change for many users. Fortunately the upgrade path is simple:

If your data object looks like

```
data={[
  { x: 1, y: 1, fill: "red", opacity: 0.2 },
  ...
]}
```

Add the following functional styles:

```
style={{ data:  { fill: (d) => d.fill, opacity: (d) => d.opacity } }}
```

and everything will work as before.

_Limit Pre-calculating label props_
Base props for labels will no longer be pre-calculated unless a labels prop exists. This change improves performance, but it will be a breaking change for users who were using events for adding labels to elements that did not already have them using an event mutation like:

```
events={[{
  target: "data",
  eventHandlers: {
    onClick: () => {
      return [{ target: "labels", mutation: () => ({ text: "clicked" }) }];
    }
  }
}]}
```

If you are using this pattern, you can make labels work as expected by adding a dummy labels prop like: `labels={() => null}`

Note: This change _does not_ affect tooltips, which exist, but are invisible until they receive the `active` prop

## 0.24.4 (2018-01-08)

VictoryCore

- [324](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-core/pull/324) Adds support for external event mutations
  - Adds `externalEventMutations` prop to `VictorySharedEvents` and all components enhanced with the `add-events` HOC
  - `externalEventMutations` prop format:
  ````js
  externalEventMutations: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape({
   callback: PropTypes.func,
   childName: PropTypes.oneOfType([
     PropTypes.string,
     PropTypes.array
   ]),
   eventKey: PropTypes.oneOfType([
     PropTypes.array,
     CustomPropTypes.allOfType([CustomPropTypes.integer, CustomPropTypes.nonNegative]),
     PropTypes.string
   ]),
   mutation: PropTypes.func,
   target: PropTypes.oneOfType([
     PropTypes.string,
     PropTypes.array
   ])
  }))
  ```
  *Note:* `eventKey` and `target` must be specified for externalEventMutations. When using `extenalEventMutations` with shared events (_i.e._ events on VictoryChart etc), `childName` is also required.
  ````

_Note:_ The `callback` supplied to `externalEventMutations` should be used for clearing mutations. This is crucial for animating charts

## 0.24.0 (2017-10-19)

**Breaking Changes**

- [victory-chart/527](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/527)
  - adds an `invertAxis` prop for `VictoryAxis` that will flip the domain of a given axis when true. Changing the `orientation` prop of a given axis will no longer flip the domain on that axis _unless_ the `invertAxis` prop is also set.
  - `tickFormat` as an array will set the number of ticks if `tickValues` are not given.
  - `tickValues` will be forced to a unique array. `tickFormat` may still have non-unique values.
  - `tickCount` will now always have an effect when set. Previously, this prop would do nothing when `tickValues` were provided. Now `tickCount` will downsample any array provided to either `tickValues` or `tickFormat`.

Other Changes

VictoryChart

- [529](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/529) `VictoryChart` no longer calculates `tickValues` or `tickFormat` for axis children. `stringMap` and `categories` are passed to axis components instead.

## 0.21.0 (2017-06-06)

- [victory-core/240](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-core/pull/240) Polar Charts
- [victory-chart/466](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/466) Polar Charts
- [victory-chart/475](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/475) Brush and Zoom fixes
- [victory-chart/476](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/476) Zoom Improvements

**Breaking Changes**

- Removes default bar width from themes
- Changes how default bar widths are calculated
- Changes render methods for `Area`, `Bar` and `Curve` primitives (Breaking change for `victory-native` and others extending primitives)
- Changes function signatures for `Selection.getDomainCoordinates` and `Selection.getDataCoordinates` (Breaking change for `victory-native`)

**Overview**

- Supports polar charts by adding the `polar` prop to charts.
- Polar charts are supported for `VictoryArea`, `VictoryChart`, `VictoryGroup`, `VictoryLine`, `VictoryScatter` `VictoryStack` and `VictoryVoronoi`
- Polar charts are supported for `VictoryBar`, but horizontal (radial) bars are not yet supported
- Polar charts work with `VictoryVoronoiContainer`
- Polar charts work with `VictorySelectionContainer`, but the dimension prop is not supported for polar selections
- Polar charts work with `VictoryZoomContainer`, but zooming is limited to centered radial zooming. Panning has no effect.
- Polar-specific default animations for `VictoryLine` and `VictoryArea`
- _horizontal polar charts are not yet supported_
- _`VictoryCandlestick` and `VictoryErrorBar` do not yet work with polar charts_
- _`VictoryCursorContainer` does not yet work with polar charts_
- _`VictoryBrushContainer` does not work with polar charts_
- _`VictoryZoomContainer` has limitations for polar charts_

**Planned additional work**

- Support for radial bars
- Support for spider charts (i.e. linear grid lines rather than arcs on polar charts)
- Support separate theming for polar charts (at least axes)
- Support for a polar version of `VictoryCursorContainer`
- Minimal support for polar versions of `VictoryCandleStick` and `VictoryErrorBar` (Elements will be correctly positioned and angled, but path elements will not be altered to reflect curvature, _i.e._ candles will still be `rects` rather than arc paths)
- Investigate hollow polar charts

**Details**

- Adds `VictoryPolarAxis` with new props: `axisAngle` `startAngle`, `endAngle`, and `labelPlacement`
- Adds `polar`, `startAngle`, `endAngle`, and `defaultPolarAxes` props for `VictoryChart`
- Adds `polar`, `origin`, and `range` props to all chart types.
- Adds `defaultPolarTransitions` static methods to `VictoryLine` and `VictoryArea`
- Uses `LabelHelpers` to simplify all `helper-methods`
- Adds a new `Arc` primitive which is used for polar axes and grid lines
- Adds `polar` and `origin` props to rendered components (primitives, `VictoryLabel`, `VictoryClipContainer` `VictoryContainer`)
- Supports radial areas for `Area` and `Curve`. These props have no effect for cartesian charts
- Adds an `openPath` prop for `Curve`. This prop is used to determine whether radial curves should be closed. Curves are closed by default, but when this prop is set to true they will not be. This prop has no effect for cartesian charts
- Supports polar bars in the `Bar` primitive. (Angular bars only, radial bars are not yet supported)
- Adds a `labelPlacement` prop to `VictoryLabel` and `VictoryTooltip`. Values are "parallel", "perpendicular", and "vertical". These flags help to appropriately position labels in polar charts. Polar charts will use "parallel" label placement by default. Cartesian charts will only use "'vertical" placement.
- Adds support for circular clipPath
- Adds support for polar animation transitions for continuous chart types. During `onLoad`, all points grow from zero. During `onEnter` and `onExit` new points are added / removed at the location of an adjacent point to keep path interpolation as smooth as possible. This implementation obviates the need for radial clip-path animations for these chart types.
- `before` and `after` callbacks for `onLoad`, `onEnter` and `onExit` are now called with `datum`, `index`, and `data` instead of only `datum`.
- Adds `LabelHelpers`
- Adds helper methods for polar charts

## 0.20.0 (2017-05-24)

**Breaking Changes** -[victory-chart/471](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/471) Passes the string value of ticks to the `tickFormat` function rather than the associated index. _This may be a breaking change for users who are using categorical data and formatting tick values by index_

**New Features** -[victory-chart/474](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/474) Adds support for a y0 accessor so that users can have granular control over the baseline of components like `VictoryArea` -[victory-core/246](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-core/pull/246) Adds an `itemsPerRow` prop to `VictoryLegend` to support automatic legend wrapping

**Minor Changes** -[victory-chart/472](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/472) Fixes a bug that was causing `VictoryGroup` to override styles on any independent `VictoryLabel` children -[victory-core/244](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-core/pull/244) Passes missing `datum` and `index` props to `Flyout` -[victory-chart/250](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-core/pull/250) Audits `shouldComponentUpdate` logic for all primitive components so that changes to optional props like `className` will cause components to re-render. -[victory-pie/146](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-pie/pull/146) Rounds label positions for `VictoryPie`

- Support multi-repo tooling

## 0.18.0 (2017-02-27)

**(VictoryVoronoiContainer)**

**BREAKING CHANGES**

- `VictoryTooltip` no longer automatically adds the `active` prop to data when hovered. To turn this behavior on, set the new `activateData` boolean prop on `VictoryTooltip`
- Deprecates `label` in favor of `labels` in `VictoryLine` and `VictoryArea`, allowing individual data labels for these components like in other Victory components. This will be a breaking change for anyone using the `label` prop in `VictoryLine` or `VictoryArea`. Series labels will need to be configured manually.
- `VictoryZoomContainer` now zooms both x and y dimensions, use the prop `dimension="x"` to return to the old behavior
- `VictoryZoomContainer` now centers zoom behavior on the mouse position rather than the center of the chart
- `VictoryZoomContainer` has a minimum zoom level of the extent of the domain / 1000. Set a custom minimum with the `minimumZoom` prop, which takes an object with numeric values for x and/ or y.
- `VictoryBrushContainer` no longer has `dimension="x"` as the default value.

**Deprecation Notice**
`VictoryVoronoi` and `VictoryVoronoiTooltip` have been replaced by `VictoryVoronoiContainer` and will be deprecated in version 0.20.0

[victory-core/196](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-core/pull/196)

- `VictoryTooltip` no longer automatically adds the `active` prop to data when hovered. To turn this behavior on, set the new `activateData` boolean prop on `VictoryTooltip`
- Adds a `theme` prop to `VictoryContainer` so that custom containers may pick up themes from their parents
- Removes default `title` and `desc` props from `VictoryContainer`
- Adds support for providing `text` as an array for `VictoryLabel`
- Adds support for providing `style` as an array for `VictoryLabel` so that each line of a multi-line label may be styled independently
- Changes how null data values are handled by `Area` and `Curve` primitives
- Adds a `reduceChildren` method to `Helpers` to ensure order consistency when working with nested children

[victory-core/201](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-core/pull/201)

- implements data sorting for all components with a `sortKey` props

[victory-chart/432](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/432)

- Adds `VictoryVoronoiContainer` for hover events (tooltips). `VictoryVoronoiContainer` has several benefits over `VictoryVoronoi` and `VictoryVoronoiTooltip`
  - Supports multi-dataset voronoi
  - Much better performance (voronoi polygons are not actually rendered, so the number of nodes rendered is dramatically lower)
  - Supports multi-data tooltips
  - Supports rectangular selections with a dimension prop
    _i.e._ `dimension="x"` creates vertical hover areas for every unique x value in all child data
- Deprecates `label` in favor of `labels` in `VictoryLine` and `VictoryArea`, allowing individual data labels for these components like in other Victory components. This will be a breaking change for anyone using the `label` prop in `VictoryLine` or `VictoryArea`. Series labels will need to be configured manually
- Changes how null values are handled in `VictoryArea`, and groups all line and area segments (i.e. split by null values) into the same `eventKey`, so that they operate as a single line for the purposes of events.

[victory-chart/438](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/438)

- Supports x and y dimension zooming in `VictoryZoomContainer`
- Adds a `minimumZoom` prop for `VictoryZoomContainer`
- Zooming centers on mouse position rather than in the center of the chart

[victory-core/207](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-core/pull/207)

- Adds a `translateY` prop for `ClipPath` to support x, y zoom behavior
- Removes default `clipPadding` in `ClipPath`

**Breaking Changes**

- Default styles and some default props have changed across all components in this release.

_VictoryTheme_

- All Victory components support a `theme` prop that can be used to define styles and props across different component types.
- `victory-core` includes the [material theme](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-core/blob/main/src/victory-theme/material.js)

_VictoryCandlestick_

- The new `VictoryCandlestick` component may be used standalone or in conjunction with `VictoryChart`. It has an identical API and feature set as other chart compatible components with the exception of the `data` and data accessor props. `VictoryCandlestick` expects `data` in the form `[{x: value, high: NUMBER, low: NUMBER, open: NUMBER, close: NUMBER}...]`, and includes data accessor props `x`, `high`, `low`, `open`, and `close`.

_VictoryErrorBar_

- The new `VictoryErrorBar` component may be used standalone or in conjunction with `VictoryChart`. It has an identical API and feature set as other chart compatible components with the exception of the `data` and data accessor props. `VictoryErrorBar` expects `data` in the form `[{x: value, y: value, errorX: ERR, errorY: ERR}...]`, Where `ERR` is a number or a two value array for asymmetric errors. `VictoryErrorBar` also includes data accessor props `errorX` and `errorY`.

_VictoryNative_

- Changes have been made across all components in order to support [victory-native](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-native). `VictoryNative` has an identical API to `Victory`, and reuses most of the code. Changes made to `Victory` to support `VictoryNative` are all non-breaking, and minimal. They include the addition of a `groupComponent` prop in all components (which defaults to `<g>`), removing svg transforms whenever possible in favor of absolute positioning, and code reorganization.

_Performance improvements_

- Low-hanging performance improvements included in this release:
  - Replace `Object.assign` with lodash `assign`
  - Replace `map` / `reduce` array methods with length-cached `for` loops in methods responsible for rendering elements

_Misc_

- Improvements for `domainPadding`
  - `domainPadding` is supported in all components compatible with `VictoryChart`
  - Negative and asymmetric `domainPadding` is supported. Example: `domainPadding={{x: [-20, 20], y: 50}}`
  - Grouped bar charts get automatic `domainPadding` so that bars wont overflow axes in most cases.
- Adds Aria roles for all rendered elements
- Fixes [bugs related to log scales](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/317)
- Fixes [a bug related to time scales](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/318)
- Improves consistency for charts with empty and single value data arrays
- Removes `reduce-calc-css` as a dependency

## 0.9.0 (2016-06-17)

_Events enhancements_

- Supports events on parent containers (_i.e._ top level `<svg>`) via the `parent` namespace in the `events` prop
- In VictoryChart, `parent` events have access to `width`, `height`, `style` and the calculated `scale` (with `domain` and `range` already applied). Where applicable `parent` events also have access to `data`
- in VictoryPie `parent` events have access to `width`, `height`, `style` and the calculated `slices` and the calculated `pathFuncton`
- When mutating elements via the return from event handlers, mutation objects may now take arrays for `eventKey` to target several individual elements, or the special value "all" to apply changes to all elements of a particular target type
- Associates parent events with child events via a `container` prop on `VictorySharedEvents`. This is useful where shared events are automatic as in `VictoryChart`, `VictoryStack` and `VictoryGroup`

_VictoryContainer_

- Supports a custom `containerComponent` in all chart types.
- `containerComponent` defaults to the new `VictoryContainer` which renders an `<svg>` with default `title` and `description` aria roles

_Full support for horizontal bar charts_

- Fixes bugs related to axis layout of horizontal bar charts

_Misc improvements_

- Adds `vectorEffect: "non-scaling-stroke"` where applicable for improved readability in responsive charts
- Increases default `fontSizes` for improved readability
- Removes parent transform from `VictoryAxis` so that custom elements can be absolutely positioned more easily
- Alters `VictoryAxis` render order to that grids are rendered _under_ labels
- Alters the render order of _default_ axes in `VictoryChart` so that default axes will render under data. Explicitly defined axes will still render in whatever order they are defined
- Adds a `cornerRadius` prop to `VictoryPie` to enable pie slices with rounded corners. Thanks @judikdavid!
- Renders all pie slices _before_ labels to prevent slices from overlapping labels

_Bug fixes_

- Fixes a bug related to transforms for `VictoryLabel`
- Fixes a bug in `VictoryGroup` that was causing custom `labelComponents` in its children to be overridden.
- Fixes a bug related to incorrect an incorrect default `tickFormat` being applied to dates

## 0.8.0 (2016-06-01)

- Upgrades to React 15
- Supports wrapped components in `VictoryChart`
- Adds `VictorySharedEvents` wrapper for coordinating events between supported Victory Components. An annotated example of the new events API:

```
<VictorySharedEvents
  events={[
    {
      childName: "firstBar", // if a child name is not provided, event will be attached to all children.
      target: "data", // what type of element to attach to. Matches the style namespaces
      eventKey: 1, // What event key of element to attach to. Defaults to the index in data.
      eventHandlers: {
        onClick: () => {
          return {
            childName: "secondBar", // the child to be modified
            // props here are the props that define the targeted component i.e. what is passed to an individual bar
            mutation: (props) => {
              return {style: merge({}, props.style, {fill: "blue"})}; // Whatever is returned here will override the existing props
            }
          };
        }
      }
    }, {
      childName: "secondBar",
      target: "data",
      eventKey: 0,
      eventHandlers: {
        onClick: () => { // event handlers can return an array of mutation objects with different targeted elements
          return [
            {
              childName: "firstBar",
              mutation: (props) => {
                return {style: merge({}, props.style, {fill: "cyan"})};
              }
            }, {
              mutation: (props) => { // the default target element is whatever element the handler is attached to
                return {style: merge({}, props.style, {fill: "orange"})};
              }
            }, {
              target: "labels",
              eventKey: 1,
              mutation: () => {
                return {text: "CLICKED"};
              }
            }
          ];
        }
      }
    }
  ]}
>
  <VictoryBar
    name="firstBar" // if children don't have name props they can be referenced by index in shared events
    style={{
      data: {width: 25, fill: "gold"}
    }}
    data={[{x: "a", y: 2}, {x: "b", y: 3}, {x: "c", y: 4}]}
  />
  <VictoryBar
    name="secondBar"
    data={[{x: "a", y: 2}, {x: "b", y: 3}, {x: "c", y: 4}]}
  />
</VictorySharedEvents>
```

## 0.7.0 (2016-05-13)

- improves consistency for `labelComponent` and `dataComponent` props. Replaces a custom label components with `VictoryLabel` to make the api more consistent and predictable. **This is a breaking change for custom label components**, as `VictoryLabel` expects a different set of props than the previous label components. See [VictoryLabel](http://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-label) for more detail.

- Custom components are now supported for all rendered axis elements (axis, axisLabel, grid, ticks, tickLabels)

- All data and label components now have access to scale so that they can create correctly scaled elements from data i.e. error bars.

- Functional styles and props are now all evaluated before they are passed as props to `labelComponent` or `dataComponent`, so that custom components will have access to the final values.

- events are bound and partially applied prior to being passed as props to `labelComponent` or `dataComponent`

- it is now possible to specify `angle` and `verticalAnchor` props for`VictoryLabel` via the style object

- event return values are stored differently on state to facilitate interaction between data and labels. **This is a breaking change for events** as event handlers must now return an object with `data` and/or `labels` keys so that these values may be applied appropriately to data and label elements respectively.

## 0.6.1 (2016-04-19)

- Fixes a bug in VictoryChart, VictoryGroup and VictoryStack, which was causing null animation props to be ignored.

## 0.6.0 (2016-04-15)

**BREAKING CHANGES**

- VictoryBar and VictoryArea no longer support multiple datasets.
- VictoryStack and VictoryGroup define stacked and grouped layouts for their children
- Custom data components supported on for VictoryBar, VictoryLine, VictoryScatter,
  VictoryArea, and VictoryPie via the `dataComponent` prop
- Enter and exit transitions animate. Enter and exit transition defaults defined
  VictoryBar, VictoryArea, VictoryScatter, VictoryLine and VictoryPie. Custom transitions may be
  defined via the `onExit` and `onEnter` properties of the `animation` prop
- Top level svgs are all responsive by default (using svg viewBox). To render a fixed size
  component, set the `standalone` prop to false and render the component inside an svg tag

## 0.5.0 (2016-03-15)

- Adds VictoryArea as a data type compatible with VictoryChart.
- Supports custom label components
- Upgrades all repos to lodash 4

## 0.4.1 (2016-03-01)

- Remove dependency on Radium
- Many performance improvements via memoization and replacing expensive merge operations
- Ignore source maps for smaller NPM installation
- Add `npm start` and `npm test` scripts for easier contribution dev workflow
- Show gzipped size for minified distribution file
- Code reorganization
- Update roadmap

## 0.4.0 (2016-01-31)

- Data Accessors are supported on all relevant components
- Shared code has been factored into VictoryUtil

Breaking Changes:

- VictoryLine and VictoryScatter:
  - plotting functions via the `y` prop must now be expressed as functions of
    data rather than functions of x. _i.e._ `y={(data) => Math.sin(data.x)}`
- VictoryBar:
  - the domain of the dependent axis will automatically include zero unless a domain is specified via props
  - automatic alphabetic data sorting has been removed
  - automatic 1% domain padding has been removed
- VictoryChart:
  - automatic 1% domain padding has been removed
  - default line data has been removed, so `<VictoryChart/>` with no additional props will now only render a set of
    axes with no data

## 0.3.0 (2016-01-26)

- Demo application now works with hot reloading.
- Application dependencies like `radium` and `lodash` now live in components, not in the Builder archetype. This is a breaking change. https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/issues/176

## 0.2.0 (2016-01-15)

- Upgrade to Radium 0.16.2. This is a breaking change if you're using media queries or keyframes in your components. Please review upgrade guide at https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium/blob/master/docs/guides/upgrade-v0.16.x.md

## 0.1.3 (2015-12-30)

- Fix build

## 0.1.2 (2015-12-30)

- Add Cumulative min and max
- Fix Firefox date issue

## 0.1.1 (2015-12-29)

- Fix issue with exported `dist` file. You can now include Victory via `npmcdn`: `https://npmcdn.com/victory/dist/victory.min.js`

## 0.1.0 (2015-12-18)

The following components documented and ready to use; API subject to change:

- victory-animation
- victory-axis
- victory-bar
- victory-chart
- victory-label
- victory-line
- victory-pie
- victory-scatter

Functional styles and functional props (where appropriate) are implemented for all the data primitives (VictoryBar, VictoryLine etc.) and VictoryAxis

Components use d3-modules

Basic code coverage across all Victory components.

We make no promises about any code prior to this release. From this point on, you can expect a regular release schedule (~every two weeks) with detailed release notes. Check out our roadmap for upcoming features

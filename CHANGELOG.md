[518](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/pull/518)
  - Support multi-repo tooling

## 0.18.0 (2017-02-27)
**(VictoryVoronoiContainer)**

**BREAKING CHANGES**
  - `VictoryTooltip` no longer automatically adds the `active` prop to data when hovered. To turn this behavior on, set the new `activateData` boolean prop on `VictoryTooltip`
  - Deprecates `label` in favor of `labels` in `VictoryLine` and `VictoryArea`, allowing individual data labels for these components like in other Victory components. This will be a breaking change for anyone using the `label` prop in `VictoryLine` or `VictoryArea`. Series labels will need to be configured manually.
  - `VictoryZoomContainer` now zooms both x and y dimensions, use the prop `dimension="x"` to return to the old behavior
  - `VictoryZoomContainer` now centers zoom behavior on the mouse position rather than the center of the chart
  - `VictoryZoomContainer` has a minimum zoom level of the extent of the domain / 1000. Set a custom minimum with the `minimumZoom` prop, which takes an object with numeric values for x and/ or y.
  - `VictoryBrushContainer` no longer has `dimension="x"` as the default value.

**Deprecation Notice**
`VictoryVoronoi` and `VictoryVoronoiTooltip` have been replaced by `VictoryVoronoiContainer` and will be deprecated in version 0.20.0

[victory-core/196](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-core/pull/196)
- `VictoryTooltip` no longer automatically adds the `active` prop to data when hovered. To turn this behavior on, set the new `activateData` boolean prop on `VictoryTooltip`
- Adds a `theme` prop to `VictoryContainer` so that custom containers may pick up themes from their parents
- Removes default `title` and `desc` props from `VictoryContainer`
- Adds support for providing `text` as an array for `VictoryLabel`
- Adds support for providing `style` as an array for `VictoryLabel` so that each line of a multi-line label may be styled independently
- Changes how null data values are handled by `Area` and `Curve` primitives
- Adds a `reduceChildren` method to `Helpers` to ensure order consistency when working with nested children

[victory-core/201](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-core/pull/201)
- implements data sorting for all components with a `sortKey` props

[victory-chart/432](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/432)
- Adds `VictoryVoronoiContainer` for hover events (tooltips). `VictoryVoronoiContainer` has several benefits over `VictoryVoronoi` and `VictoryVoronoiTooltip`
  - Supports multi-dataset voronoi
  - Much better performance (voronoi polygons are not actually rendered, so the number of nodes rendered is dramatically lower)
  - Supports multi-data tooltips
  - Supports rectangular selections with a dimension prop
    _i.e._ `dimension="x"` creates vertical hover areas for every unique x value in all child data
- Deprecates `label` in favor of `labels` in `VictoryLine` and `VictoryArea`, allowing individual data labels for these components like in other Victory components. This will be a breaking change for anyone using the `label` prop in `VictoryLine` or `VictoryArea`. Series labels will need to be configured manually
- Changes how null values are handled in `VictoryArea`, and groups all line and area segments (i.e. split by null values) into the same `eventKey`, so that they operate as a single line for the purposes of events.

[victory-chart/438](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/438)
- Supports x and y dimension zooming in `VictoryZoomContainer`
- Adds a `minimumZoom` prop for `VictoryZoomContainer`
- Zooming centers on mouse position rather than in the center of the chart

[victory-core/207](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-core/pull/207)
- Adds a `translateY` prop for `ClipPath` to support x, y zoom behavior
- Removes default `clipPadding` in `ClipPath`

## 0.17.0 (2017-02-05)

- [victory-core/195](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-core/pull/195)
  - Fixes null event state bug
- [victory-chart/431](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/431)
  - Sets a maximum amount of scale per zoom event for smoother interaction with fast onWheel events

## 0.16.1 (2017-02-03)

- [victory-chart/429](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/429)
- Throttles `onWheel` and `onMouseMove` events on Victory container components

**Breaking Changes**
- Default styles and some default props have changed across all components in this release.

*VictoryTheme*
- All Victory components support a `theme` prop that can be used to define styles and props across different component types.
- `victory-core` includes the [material theme](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-core/blob/master/src/victory-theme/material.js)

*VictoryCandlestick*
- The new `VictoryCandlestick` component may be used standalone or in conjunction with `VictoryChart`. It has an idential API and feature set as other chart compatible components with the exception of the `data` and data accessor props. `VictoryCandlestick` expects `data` in the form `[{x: value, high: NUMBER, low: NUMBER, open: NUMBER, close: NUMBER}...]`, and includes data sccessor props `x`, `high`, `low`, `open`, and `close`.

*VictoryErrorBar*
- The new `VictoryErrorBar` component may be used standalone or in conjunction with `VictoryChart`. It has an idential API and feature set as other chart compatible components with the exception of the `data` and data accessor props. `VictoryErrorBar` expects `data` in the form `[{x: value, y: value, errorX: ERR, errorY: ERR}...]`, Where `ERR` is a number or a two value array for asymmetric errors. `VictoryErrorBar` also includes data accessor props `errorX` and `errorY`.

*VictoryNative*
- Changes have been made across all components in order to support [victory-native](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-native). `VictoryNative` has an identical API to `Victory`, and reuses most of the code. Changes made to `Victory` to support `VictoryNative` are all non-breaking, and minimal. They include the addition of a `groupComponent` prop in all components (which defaults to `<g>`), removing svg transforms whenever possible in favor of absolute positioning, and code reorganization.

*Performance improvements*
- Low-hanging performance improvements included in this release:
  - Replace `Object.assign` with lodash `assign`
  - Replace `map` / `reduce` array methods with length-cached `for` loops in methods responsible for rendering elements

*Misc*
- Improvements for `domainPadding`
  - `domainPadding` is supported in all components compatible with `VictoryChart`
  - Negative and asymmetric `domainPadding` is supported. Example: `domainPadding={{x: [-20, 20], y: 50}}`
  - Grouped bar charts get automatic `domainPadding` so that bars wont overflow axes in most cases.
- Adds Aria roles for all rendered elements
- Fixes [bugs related to log scales](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/317)
- Fixes [a bug related to time scales](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory-chart/pull/318)
- Improves consistency for charts with empty and single value data arrays
- Removes `reduce-calc-css` as a dependency


## 0.9.0 (2016-06-17)

*Events enhancements*
- Supports events on parent containers (_i.e._ top level `<svg>`) via the `parent` namespace in the `events` prop
- In VictoryChart, `parent` events have access to `width`, `height`, `style` and the calculated `scale` (with `domain` and `range` already applied). Where applicable `parent` events also have access to `data`
- in VictoryPie `parent` events have access to `width`, `height`, `style` and the calculated `slices` and the calculated `pathFuncton`
- When mutating elements via the return from event handlers, mutation objects may now take arrays for `eventKey` to target several individual elements, or the special value "all" to apply changes to all elements of a particular target type
- Associates parent events with child events via a `container` prop on `VictorySharedEvents`. This is useful where shared events are automatic as in `VictoryChart`, `VictoryStack` and `VictoryGroup`

*VictoryContainer*
- Supports a custom `containerComponent` in all chart types.
- `containerComponent` defaults to the new `VictoryContainer` which renders an `<svg>` with default `title` and `description` aria roles

*Full support for horizontal bar charts*
- Fixes bugs related to axis layout of horizontal bar charts

*Misc improvements*
- Adds `vectorEffect: "non-scaling-stroke"` where applicable for improved readability in responsive charts
- Increases default `fontSizes` for improved readability
- Removes parent transform from `VictoryAxis` so that custom elements can be absolutely positioned more easily
- Alters `VictoryAxis` render order to that grids are rendered _under_ labels
- Alters the render order of _default_ axes in `VictoryChart` so that default axes will render under data. Explicitly defined axes will still render in whatever order they are defined
- Adds a `cornerRadius` prop to `VictoryPie` to enable pie slices with rounded corners. Thanks @judikdavid!
- Renders all pie slices _before_ labels to prevent slices from overlapping labels

*Bug fixes*
- Fixes a bug related to transforms for `VictoryLabel`
- Fixes a bug in `VictoryGroup` that was causing custom `labelComponents` in its children to be overridden.
- Fixes a bug related to incorrect an incorrect default `tickFormat` being applied to dates

## 0.8.0 (2016-06-01)

- Upgrades to React 15
- Supports wrapped components in `VictoryChart`
- Adds `VictorySharedEvents` wrapper for coordinating events between supported Victory Components. An annotated example of the new events API:

```
<VictorySharedEvents
  events={[
    {
      childName: "firstBar", // if a child name is not provided, event will be attached to all children.
      target: "data", // what type of element to attach to. Matches the style namespaces
      eventKey: 1, // What event key of element to attach to. Defaults to the index in data.
      eventHandlers: {
        onClick: () => {
          return {
            childName: "secondBar", // the child to be modified
            // props here are the props that define the targeted component i.e. what is passed to an individual bar
            mutation: (props) => {
              return {style: merge({}, props.style, {fill: "blue"})}; // Whatever is returned here will override the existing props
            }
          };
        }
      }
    }, {
      childName: "secondBar",
      target: "data",
      eventKey: 0,
      eventHandlers: {
        onClick: () => { // event handlers can return an array of mutation objects with different targeted elements
          return [
            {
              childName: "firstBar",
              mutation: (props) => {
                return {style: merge({}, props.style, {fill: "cyan"})};
              }
            }, {
              mutation: (props) => { // the default target element is whatever element the handler is attached to
                return {style: merge({}, props.style, {fill: "orange"})};
              }
            }, {
              target: "labels",
              eventKey: 1,
              mutation: () => {
                return {text: "CLICKED"};
              }
            }
          ];
        }
      }
    }
  ]}
>
  <VictoryBar
    name="firstBar" // if children don't have name props they can be referenced by index in shared events
    style={{
      data: {width: 25, fill: "gold"}
    }}
    data={[{x: "a", y: 2}, {x: "b", y: 3}, {x: "c", y: 4}]}
  />
  <VictoryBar
    name="secondBar"
    data={[{x: "a", y: 2}, {x: "b", y: 3}, {x: "c", y: 4}]}
  />
</VictorySharedEvents>
```

## 0.7.0 (2016-05-13)

 - improves consistency for `labelComponent` and `dataComponent` props. Replaces a custom label components with `VictoryLabel` to make the api more consistent and predictable. **This is a breaking change for custom label components**, as `VictoryLabel` expects a different set of props than the previous label components. See [VictoryLabel](http://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/victory-label) for more detail.

 - Custom components are now supported for all rendered axis elements (axis, axisLabel, grid, ticks, tickLabels)

 - All data and label components now have access to scale so that they can create correctly scaled elements from data i.e. error bars.

- Functional styles and props are now all evaluated before they are passed as props to `labelComponent` or `dataComponent`, so that custom components will have access to the final values.

- events are bound and partially applied prior to being passed as props to `labelComponent` or `dataComponent`

- it is now possible to specify `angle` and `verticalAnchor` props for` VictoryLabel` via the style object

- event return values are stored differently on state to facilitate interaction between data and labels. **This is a breaking change for events** as event handlers must now return an object with with `data` and/or `labels` keys so that these values may be applied appropriately to data and label elements respectively.

## 0.6.1 (2016-04-19)

- Fixes a bug in VictoryChart, VictoryGroup and VictoryStack, which was causing null animation props to be ignored.

## 0.6.0 (2016-04-15)

**BREAKING CHANGES**

- VictoryBar and VictoryArea no longer support multiple datasets.
- VictoryStack and VictoryGroup define stacked and grouped layouts for their children
- Custom data components supported on for VictoryBar, VictoryLine, VictoryScatter,
  VictoryArea, and VictoryPie via the `dataComponent` prop
- Enter and exit transitions animate. Enter and exit transition defaults defined
  VictoryBar, VictoryArea, VictoryScatter, VictoryLine and VictoryPie. Custom transitions may be
  defined via the `onExit` and `onEnter` properties of the `animation` prop
- Top level svgs are all responsive by default (using svg viewBox). To render a fixed size
  component, set the `standalone` prop to false and render the component inside an svg tag

## 0.5.0 (2016-03-15)

- Adds VictoryArea as a data type compatible with VictoryChart.
- Supports custom label components
- Upgrades all repos to lodash 4

## 0.4.1 (2016-03-01)

- Remove dependency on Radium
- Many performance improvements via memoization and replacing expensive merge operations
- Ignore source maps for smaller NPM installation
- Add `npm start` and `npm test` scripts for easier contribution dev workflow
- Show gzipped size for minified distribution file
- Code reorganization
- Update roadmap

## 0.4.0 (2016-01-31)

- Data Accessors are supported on all relevant components
- Shared code has been factored into VictoryUtil

Breaking Changes:
  - VictoryLine and VictoryScatter:
    - plotting functions via the `y` prop must now be expressed as functions of
      data rather than functions of x. _i.e._ `y={(data) => Math.sin(data.x)}`
  - VictoryBar:
    - the domain of the dependent axis will automatically include zero unless a domain is specified via props
    - automatic alphabetic data sorting has been removed
    - automatic 1% domain padding has been removed
  - VictoryChart:
    - automatic 1% domain padding has been removed
    - default line data has been removed, so `<VictoryChart/>` with no additional props will now only render a set of
      axes with no data

## 0.3.0 (2016-01-26)

- Demo application now works with hot reloading.
- Application dependencies like `radium` and `lodash` now live in components, not in the Builder archetype. This is a breaking change. https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/issues/176

## 0.2.0 (2016-01-15)

- Upgrade to Radium 0.16.2. This is a breaking change if you're using media queries or keyframes in your components. Please review upgrade guide at https://github.com/FormidableLabs/radium/blob/master/docs/guides/upgrade-v0.16.x.md

## 0.1.3 (2015-12-30)

## 0.1.0 (2015-12-18)

The following components documented and ready to use; API subject to change:

- victory-animation
- victory-axis
- victory-bar
- victory-chart
- victory-label
- victory-line
- victory-pie
- victory-scatter
